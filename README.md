# Graph Drawing Tool 📈🔧

## Introduction ℹ️
This is a graph drawing tool implemented in Python, suitable for students in middle school. The tool utilizes Tkinter, NumPy, and Matplotlib libraries to allow you to input mathematical equations and plot their corresponding graphs on a window.

## Prerequisites 🛠️
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Installation ⬇️
1. Clone the repository or download the `graph_tool.py` file.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your computer.
3. Install the required libraries using pip:
   ```
   pip install numpy matplotlib
   ```

## Usage 🚀
1. Run the `graph_tool.py` file.
2. Input a valid mathematical equation in the provided input field.
3. Click the "Draw Graph" button to plot the graph.
4. If there's an error in the equation, an error message will be displayed. ❌
5. To clear the graph, click the "Clear Graph" button. 🔄

## Example 🌟
- Input: `x**2 + y**2 - 25`
- Output: A graph of the equation `x**2 + y**2 - 25 = 0`. 📈

## Notes 📝
- Ensure the entered mathematical equation is valid and supported by the `eval` function.
- This tool supports 2D graphs only.
